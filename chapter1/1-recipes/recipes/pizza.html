    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            <strong>Infuse the Oil:</strong>
            Mix olive oil with finely minced garlic in a small bowl.
            Let it sit for about 10 minutes so the garlic flavor fully infuses the oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
            Stretch your pizza dough onto a pizza tray (ideally one with holes for extra crispiness).
            Aim for an even thickness and leave a raised edge for the crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
            Brush the garlic-infused oil evenly over the base.
            Sprinkle with grated parmesan, then cover generously with mozzarella,
            leaving the edges bare for a golden crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong>
            Place in a preheated oven at 250°C (480°F).
            Bake for about 8 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through,
            until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong>
            Slice into wedges and enjoy hot, ideally with extra olive oil or fresh herbs on top.
        </li>
    </ol>
